Hello!
I'm Andrew; I'm a software infrastructure engineer working on [Vitess] for [Planetscale].
Before that I worked at [Slack] on the datastores team, first as a Database Reliability Engineer, and then primarily on Vitess itself.
I'm also a Vitess maintainer.

A teammate once referred to me as a Professional Database Mercenary.

When I'm not working on databases, you can find me tinkering on a [side project] (usually in Go), or out for a run, reading a book, or playing a video game (usually by _[FromSoftware]_).
