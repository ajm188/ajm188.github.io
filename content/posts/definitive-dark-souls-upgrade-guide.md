<!--
Weapon and armor upgrades are more complicated in _Dark Souls_ than in either of its descendants or _Bloodborne_.

### Some terms:

**Reinforcement**: How many levels a weapon has been upgraded to on a particular upgrade path.

**Ascension**: Taking a weapon from one upgrade path to another. Ascending _up_ can only be done
with a weapon that has reached the end of its current path, while ascending _down_ (which is confusing, but correct, terminology),

**Scaling**
**Stability**

Outline:
* why upgrade
    * increases base damage, and also stat scaling bonuses
* how to upgrade
* what's ascension
* the upgrade paths
    * show the tree
* spellcasting upgrades
* upgrading shields (also, what is stability)
* upgrading armor
* special upgrades
-->

_Dark Souls_ is an opaque game, right down to the weapon upgrade system(s).
There are twelve upgrade paths, some of which are dependent on other paths,
fourteen different kinds of upgrade materials, ten different embers, and four different blacksmiths.
I'm going to attempt to lay out the rules of the system in a way that makes sense to me,
hoping that it makes sense to others.
