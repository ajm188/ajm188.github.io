This site is built with [`hugo`][hugo] and deployed via [GitHub Actions][publish_action].
It is currently styled with [`simplecss`][simplecss] with minor overrides.

The original design and layout was taken from [Jessie Frazelle's blog], with minor modifications.
This has diverged over time, most notably when I transitioned to `simplecss`.
